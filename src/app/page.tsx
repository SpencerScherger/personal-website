      <p>
        I am a rising junior at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas, pursuing a dual degree in Mathematics and Computer Science.
        Currently, I am on track to graduate at the end of the Spring 2027 semester.
        I have a passion for pure mathematics and theoretical computer science, and I am excited to start pursuing research in these areas.
        More specifically, I have drive to learn about subjects such as modern algebra, number theory, machine learning, and complexity theory.
        In the future, I hope to use my skillset to solve complex problems in any relevant field.
